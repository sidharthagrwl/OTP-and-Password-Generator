# OTP-and-Password-generator

A one time password (OTP) is a password that is valid only for one login session or transaction, on a computer system or other digital device. Many times we forget our passwords and we opt for Forgot password option and within no time we get a new password/OTP at our registered email-ID or phone number to login to our account. The code explains how to generate such Passwords and OTP within no time and what code we can use if in case we need to do so.

Algorithm - 
Randomly pick characters from our all possibilities and generate a string of the desired length from it using Math.random() class. OTPs are generally 6-7 characters long and randomness in 6-7 characters almost guarantees a secure way of logging in.

Real World Applications - 
OTPs are widely used in websites like- Facebook account login, Google Sign-in, Wifi â€“ accessing, Railways Portal Login etc.
