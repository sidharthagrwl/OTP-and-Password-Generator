# OTP-and-password-generator

A one-time password (OTP) is a password that is valid for only one login session or transaction, on a computer system or other digital device.

Algorithm - 
Randomly pick characters from our all possibilities and generate a string of the desired length from it. OTPs are generally 6-7 characters long and randomness in 6-7 characters almost guarantees a secure way of logging in.

Real World Applications - 
OTPs are widely used in websites like- Facebook, Google Sign-in, Wifi â€“ accessing, Railways Portal Login etc.

Many a time we forget our passwords and we opt for Forget password option and within no time we get a new password at our registered email-ID or phone no. to login our account. And every time we get a different password.The code explains how to generate such Passwords and OTP within no time and what code we can use if in case we need to do so.
